# Basic Malware RE
This is how I managed to solve [Basic Malware RE](https://tryhackme.com/room/basicmalwarere) challange.

I used mainly two tools, IDA and strings. Worked in Flare sandbox.

## Challenge 1

1. First, I tried `strings` on the sample file, tons of flags came out. I'm sure trying them one after another is not the most effeciant way, probably we need to take a look into the code to find out which flag among those owns the hash.
1. Time for IDA then, opened the sample file, head to the entry point which is `start` function.

1. You can easily spot where `md5_hash` subroutine is called, normally, the subroutine is applied after instruction `push eax`.
1. Now eax has its value assigned one line earlier `mov eax, off_432294` which is holding the flag we want.
